# Lesson 12 Project
The client is back for a last time with a request for you to help create a page that explains accessibility issues. They’ve provided you with instruction to update the page to fit the latest accessibility standards. They’ve also asked you to validate the page and make changes as you see fit so that the page passes the WAVE Tool, HTML Validator, and CSS Validator.

## Project Prep
1. If you haven't done so already, clone the repo to your computer within your course folder.
2. Open the repo within VS Code. You can open this `readme.md` file within VS Code to view the project directions there. 

   > **TIP:** Right click on the file and choose the `Open Preview` option.
3. If there are files and folders present other than this `readme.md` file, take some time to familiarize yourself with the files within the repo so you know where they are located. This will help you when asked to use them within the project directions.

   > **TIP:** Before beginning any work on the project, read through all the steps to understand what you will be doing.

## Update the Accessibility Page

1. If necessary, open the `accessibility.html` page.
2. Enter your first and last name as the **metadata author** on the web page.
3. Add an **HTML comment** below the !DOCTYPE and include your course name, section number, and lesson number as a comment.
4. Remove the dummy text and replace it with a short Accessibility Statement. Something like: `We are committed to providing an accessible website for all of our site visitors.` - You should create your own statement, do not copy this one.
5. Fix any broken links, including links to image files and stylesheets. All images are provided for you in the images folder.
6. Complete the information within the table by entering the following information in the appropriate cells.
    1. Provide a description of the disability.
    2. List the common barriers that are created.
    3. Identify a POUR Principle and describe the Web content that can be applied to make a website more accessible to those with each disability. 
    > **NOTE:** The information to complete the table can be found within the [Diverse Abilities and Barriers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/abilities-barriers/) page that was provided to you within your online lesson.
7. Modify the `styles.css` file by doing the following:
    1. Update the comment with your MEID as the author, your course and section number, and lesson number.


## Validate the Accessibility Page
There are several intentional errors in the HTML page and the CSS page. Validate the pages on your site and fix the errors.

1. Validate and correct the HTML by completing the following:
    1. Using an HTML Validator, validate the web page to identify all the errors with the HTML code.
    2. Document the errors with HTML comments and explain what you did to correct the error.
    3. Correct all errors identified by the HTML validator.
2. Validate and correct the CSS by completing the following:
    1. Using a CSS Validator, validate the stylesheet to identify all errors within the CSS code.
    2. Document each error with CSS comments and explain what you did to correct each error.
    3. Correct all errors identified by the CSS validator.
3. Evaluate and correct any accessibility issues by completing the following:
    1. Download and install the WAVE extension for your browser, if you didn’t already do this when reading the lesson.
    2. Open the accessibility.html file in your browser and use the WAVE accessibility evaluator to identify all the accessibility errors, contrast errors, and alerts.
    3. Create a HTML comment below the closing body tag and document the issues that were found and what you did to correct the issues.

## Submit the Project
Once you have completed your project, you need to let your instructor know that it is ready to be graded. This is done by submitting the Repo URL to the assignment in RioLearn.

   > **TIP:** If you need a refresher on how to submit your work, view: [Submitting Assignments & Viewing Feedback](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis-public/git-github-and-vs-code/submitting-assignments-and-viewing-feedback).
1. Review your work and make any necessary updates. Save the file. You can either select **FILE>SAVE** or use the keyboard shortcut **CTRL+S**.
2. **Sync** the changes and apply a final **Commit** that says: `Completed final review and updates before submission.`
3. Verify that all files appear on GitHub.

   > **TIP:** You can view any of your repos by going to the GitHub organization for the course - [RSC-CIS133DA-IN-V12 Organization](https://github.com/rsc-cis133DA-in-v12). Once you are viewing the class organization, you should see all of the Repos that you have accepted assignment invitations for. It is recommended that you bookmark this page for future reference. Push (i.e., sync) the files on your computer with GitHub to ensure all files are uploaded to GitHub for your instructor to view.
4. Right-click the link to your repository and select **Copy Link Address**.
5. Go to the Assessing Your Learning page in your RioLearn lesson, and click the link to submit the assignment. Paste the link to your repo in the assignment submission box.
