                    <td>Auditory disabilities range from mild or moderate hearing loss in one or both ears (“hard of hearing”) to substantial and uncorrectable hearing loss in both ears (“deafness”). Some people with auditory disabilities can hear sounds but sometimes not sufficiently to understand all speech, especially when there is background noise. This can include people using hearing aids.</td>

                    Media players that do not provide options to adjust the text size and colors for captions.
                    Web-based services, including web applications, that rely on interaction using voice only.

Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities do not necessarily affect the intelligence of a person.</td>
                    <td>Complex navigation mechanisms and page layouts that are difficult to understand and use.
                        Complex sentences that are difficult to read and unusual words that are difficult to understand.

                        Moving, blinking, or flickering content, and background audio that cannot be turned off.
                        Web browsers and media players that do not provide mechanisms to suppress animations and audio.

                        Operable user interface and navigation
Features available on the keyboard
Many people don't use a mouse and rely on the keyboard to interact with the web. This requires that all functionality be keyboard usable, including form, input, and other UI components.

Keyboard accessibility includes:

Any functionality available at the mouse must also be available on the keyboard
Keyboard focus should not be trapped in any part of the content
Browsers, content production tools, and other tools must be keyboard usable
Being compliant with this requirement helps people who only use the keyboard, including those using an alternate keyboard, ergonomic keyboard, on-screen virtual keyboard, or switch. It also helps people using speech recognition software to interact with websites and to dictate text through the keyboard interface.

                        Missing visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and other navigational aids.
                        Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complicated navigation mechanisms and page functions.</td>
                    <td>Understandable information and user interface
                        The text is readable and understandable
                        Content authors must ensure that textual content is readable and understandable by as many people as possible, including when the content is vocalized by text-to-speech. Such content:
                        
                        Identifies the primary language of the web page, such as Arabic, Dutch, or Korean
                        Identifies the language of text passages, foreign expressions, or other parts of the web page
                        Provides definitions for unusual words, phrases, idioms, and abbreviations
                        Uses the clearest and simplest language, or provides a simplified version.</td>

                    <th>Speech</th>
                    <td>Speech disabilities include difficulty producing speech that is recognizable by others or by voice recognition software. For example, the loudness or clarity of someone’s voice might be difficult to understand.</td>
                    <td>Web-based services, including web applications, that rely on interaction using voice only.
                        Websites that offer phone numbers as the only way to communicate with the organizations.</td>
                    <td>Robust content and reliable interpretation
                        Content is compatible with current and future user software
                        Robust content is compatible with multiple browsers, helper tools, and other user agents. This includes the following tasks:
                        
                        Ensure that the code can be interpreted reliably, for example by ensuring that it is valid
                        Provide a name, role, and value for each of the non-standard UI elements
                        Being compliant with this requirement helps maximize compatibility with current user agents, including assistive technologies. In particular, it allows assistive technologies to reliably interpret content, and present and operate it in different ways. This includes buttons, input fields, and other non-standard (scripted) controls.</td>

                    <td>Visual disabilities range from mild or moderate vision loss in one or both eyes (“low vision”) to substantial and uncorrectable vision loss in both eyes (“blindness”). Some people have reduced or lack of sensitivity to certain colors (“color blindness”), or increased sensitivity to bright colors. These variations in perception of colors and brightness can be independent of the visual acuity.</td>
                    <td>Images, controls, and other structural elements that do not have equivalent text alternatives.
                        Text, images, and page layouts that cannot be resized, or that lose information when resized.
                        Missing visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and other navigational aids.
                        Video content that does not have text or audio alternatives, or an audio-description track.
                        Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complicated navigation mechanisms and page functions.
                        Text and images with insufficient contrast between foreground and background color combinations.
                        Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not support the use of custom color combinations.

                    <td>Web Accessibility Standards
                        Web accessibility relies on several components that work together. Some of them are:
                        
                        Web content: This term applies to any part of a website, including text, images, forms, and multimedia, as well as any code, script, application, and so on.
                        User agents: software used to access web content, including desktop graphical browsers, voice browsers, mobile browsers, media players, plug-ins, and certain assistive technologies.
                        </td>
